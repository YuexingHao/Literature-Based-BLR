SEH with vertebral scalloping is extremely rare, with only a few cases having been reported to date. We report a unique case of spontaneous chronic SEH in the lumbar spine with severe vertebral scalloping mimicking an epidural tumor.
A 71-year-old man presented with a 2-month history of lumbar pain and a 3-week history of paresthesia and pain in the right lower extremity, hypesthesia in the perineal and perianal regions, and bladder dysfunction. Computed tomography following myelography revealed an epidural mass lesion on the right side that compressed the dural sac and was associated with severe bony scalloping on the posterior wall of the L4 vertebral body. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) on T1- and T2-weighted images revealed a space-occupying lesion with heterogeneous intensity, and T1-gadolinium images showed an intralesional heterogeneous enhancement effect. A tumoral lesion in the spinal canal was suspected, based on preoperative imaging; therefore, a total spinal tumor resection was planned. Intraoperative findings revealed that the brownish lesion adhered to the dura and epidural tissues in the spinal canal, and the space-occupying mass in the scalloped cavity of the posterior wall of the L4 vertebra was encapsulated in red-brownish soft tissues. The lesion was totally resected in a piecemeal fashion, and pathological examination revealed a mixture of tissues that contained a relatively new hematoma with hemoglobin, as well as an obsolete hematoma with hemosiderin and amyloid deposits. The mass was diagnosed as a chronic epidural hematoma with recurrent hemorrhage. The postoperative course was uneventful, and the preoperative neurological symptoms immediately improved.
The preoperative diagnosis of chronic SEHs is challenging, as MRI results may not be conclusive, particularly in patients with scalloping of bony structures. Thus, chronic SEHs should be considered as a differential diagnosis in cases of suspected tumoral lesions in the spinal canal. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported case of acute exacerbation of chronic SEH with cauda equina syndrome and severe vertebral scalloping."," The patient population of focus is people with chronic spinal epidural hematomas (SEHs).

However, there is an increased risk of life-threatening denosumab-induced hypocalcemia with an incidence of 0.1 to 12.8%.
Our patient is a 69-year-old man with widespread skeletal metastatic disease from primary prostate cancer who presented to the hospital complaining of generalized fatigue and joint pain.

Here, we present an investigational case report to highlight continuing challenges in diagnosing and managing Anti-GFAP associated meningoencephalomyelitis.
Our 45-year-old Asian female presented to the emergency department with an acute onset low-grade fever and back pain associated with headaches, intermittent confusion, vision changes, and hand tremors. A review of systems identified no inciting factors. Past medical history was significant only for chronic Hepatitis B without significant viral load. Neurological exam was significant for decreased visual acuity, high-frequency hand tremor, and gait imbalance. Serum labs were within normal limits. Video electroencephalogram captured tremors without electrographical correlates. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis revealed lymphocytic leukocytosis, elevated protein, and reduced glucose. A wide range of infectious studies including bacterial, viral, and fungal cultures were negative. MRI brain and spine showed leptomeningeal enhancement. CT chest abdomen pelvis were negative. Patient continued to decline clinically, working diagnosis was possible paraneoplastic syndrome with pending laboratory results. She was given a five-day course of intravenous immunoglobulin as a therapeutic trial,hh however, her symptoms did not improve. A broader investigation with repeat lumbar puncture, imaging and serum laboratory failed to provide any additional information. She was treated symptomatically with minimal benefit. A trial of steroids was given with clinical improvement and continued stability. Paraneoplastic panels returned positive for high levels of Anti-GFAP antibody for confirmation of diagnosis.

The usual indications are phimosis (inability to completely retract the foreskin and expose the glans due to a congenital or acquired constriction of the prepuce), paraphimosis (when the foreskin is not pulled back over the glans after retraction resulting in a tight constricting band which causes swelling of the distal penis and acute discomfort), balanoposthitis (erythema and edema of the prepuce and glans) and balanitis (inflammation is confined to the glans; the foreskin is usually non-retractile). Circumcision devices have been developed to shorten the operative time, simplify techniques, and improve safety and cosmetic outcomes. The devices generally aim to crush the foreskin while simultaneously creating hemostasis, the foreskin is then excised or allowed to slough off. Their use is supposedly safer and easier to replicate than the standard dissection techniques. There are at least 20 devices for male circumcision on the market, yet their effectiveness has not been reviewed to date.
To assess the effects of device-based circumcisions compared with standard surgical techniques in adolescent and adult males (10 years old and above).
We performed a comprehensive search with no restrictions to the language of publication or publication status. We searched the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE (PubMed), Embase, Web of Science, trials registries, grey literature sources and conference proceedings up to 16 April 2020.
We included randomized controlled trials of device-based circumcisions (crush or ligature circumcision devices) compared to standard surgical dissection-based circumcision conducted by health professionals in a medical setting.
At least two review authors independently assessed study eligibility and extracted data from the included studies. We classified adverse events into serious, moderate or mild. We reported study results as risk ratios (RR) or mean differences (MD) using 95% confidence intervals (CI) and a random-effects model. We used the GRADE approach to evaluate the overall certainty of the evidence for each outcome.
Eighteen trials met the inclusion criteria. Trials were conducted in China, South Africa, Kenya and Zambia, Mozambique, Rwanda, Uganda and Zimbabwe. Primary outcomes Serious adverse events: there were no serious adverse events in either treatment arm (11 trials, 3472 participants). Moderate adverse events: there may be a slight increase in moderate adverse events when devices are used compared to standard surgical techniques (RR 1.31, 95% CI 0.55 to 3.10; I²= 68%; 10 trials, 3370 participants; low-certainty evidence); this corresponds to 8 more (ranging from 15 fewer to 84 more) moderate adverse events per 1000 participants. We downgraded the certainty of the evidence for study limitations and imprecision. Secondary outcomes Mild adverse events: we are uncertain about the difference in mild adverse events between groups when devices are used compared to standard surgical techniques (RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.44 to 2.72; I² = 91%; 10 trials, 3370 participants; very low-certainty evidence). We downgraded the certainty of the evidence for study limitations, imprecision and unexplained inconsistency. Operative time: operative time is probably about 17 minutes shorter when using a device rather than standard surgical techniques, which constitutes a clinically meaningful decrease in a procedure (MD -17.26 minutes, 95% CI -19.96 to -14.57; I² = 99%; 14 trials, 4812 participants; moderate-certainty evidence). We downgraded the certainty of the evidence for serious study limitations. The standard surgical technique generally takes about 24 minutes. There may be less postoperative pain during the first 24 hours when circumcision devices are used compared to standard surgical techniques (measured using a visual analog scale [VAS]; MD 1.30 cm lower, 95% CI 2.37 lower to 0.22 lower; I² = 99%; 9 trials, 3022 participants; low-certainty evidence). We downgraded the certainty of the evidence for study limitations and unexplained heterogeneity. There may be little or no difference in postoperative pain experienced during the first seven days when compared with standard surgical techniques (measured using a VAS; MD 0.11 cm higher, 95% CI 0.89 lower to 1.11 higher; I² = 94%; 4 trials, 1430 participants; low-certainty evidence). We downgraded the certainty of the evidence for study limitations and unexplained inconsistency. A higher score on the VAS indicates greater pain. Participants may slightly prefer circumcision devices compared to standard surgical techniques (RR 1.19, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.37; I² = 97%; 15 trials, 4501 participants; low-certainty evidence). We downgraded the certainty of the evidence for study limitations and unexplained inconsistency. We recorded satisfaction as a dichotomous outcome. Higher rates reflected greater satisfaction.
We found that there were no serious adverse events reported when using a circumcision device compared to standard surgical techniques, but they may slightly increase moderate adverse effects, and it is unclear whether there is a difference in mild adverse effects. Use of circumcision devices probably reduces the time of the procedure by about 17 minutes, a clinically meaningful time saving. For patients, use of the circumcision device may result in lower pain scores during the first 24 hours and patients may be slightly more satisfied with it compared with standard surgical techniques. Clinicians, patients and policymakers can use these results in conjunction with their own contextual factors to inform the approach that best suits their healthcare settings. High-quality trials evaluating this intervention are needed to provide further certainty regarding the rates of adverse effects and postoperative pain of using devices compared to standard approaches.", The patient population of focus is adolescent and adult males (10 years old and above)., Male circumcision, The patients were randomized to receive either a circumcision device or a standard surgical technique.," The primary outcomes of focus are serious and moderate adverse events, operative time, and postoperative pain."," The study found that there were no serious adverse events reported when using a circumcision device compared to standard surgical techniques, but they may slightly increase moderate adverse effects, and it is unclear whether there is a difference in mild adverse effects.

We examined the effects of a high-demand 'working memory' 1-back task compared to a low-demand 'motor control' task on pain intensity and unpleasantness ratings in healthy children. Additionally, dispositional mindfulness was examined to explore the mechanisms of distraction on the affective processing of pain.
Fifty-seven children (9-13 years old) experienced three randomly presented heat levels (not painful, slightly painful, moderately painful) during two distraction conditions involving different levels of cognitive load (a high load 'working memory' task and a low load 'motor' control task) in counter-balanced order. Children completed measures of dispositional mindfulness, and attentional control and emotional control.
As predicted, children's pain intensity and pain unpleasantness ratings were lower in the high load condition compared to the low load condition. These differences were amplified in the moderately painful heat trials. In contrast with predictions, dispositional mindfulness did not significantly predict the effectiveness of distraction. Dispositional mindfulness was significantly related to measures of children's attentional and emotional control abilities; however, an exploratory serial mediation model did not produce significant indirect or overall effects to suggest a strong influence of mindfulness on the effectiveness of distraction.
Results demonstrate that distraction that places higher demand on executive resources is more effective for acute pain management for children. Further research is needed to explore cognitive and affective moderators of the effectiveness of distraction for children.
