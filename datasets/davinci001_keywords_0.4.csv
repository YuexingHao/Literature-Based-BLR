0,"Delirium is defined as a disturbance in attention, awareness and cognition with reduced ability to direct, focus, sustain and shift attention, and reduced orientation to the environment. Critically ill patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) frequently develop ICU delirium. It can profoundly affect both them and their families because it is associated with increased mortality, longer duration of mechanical ventilation, longer hospital and ICU stay and long-term cognitive impairment. It also results in increased costs for society.
To assess existing evidence for the effect of preventive interventions on ICU delirium, in-hospital mortality, the number of delirium- and coma-free days, ventilator-free days, length of stay in the ICU and cognitive impairment.
We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, BIOSIS, International Web of Science, Latin American Caribbean Health Sciences Literature, CINAHL from 1980 to 11 April 2018 without any language limits. We adapted the MEDLINE search for searching the other databases. Furthermore, we checked references, searched citations and contacted study authors to identify additional studies. We also checked the following trial registries: Current Controlled Trials; ClinicalTrials.gov; and CenterWatch.com (all on 24 April 2018).
We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of adult medical or surgical ICU patients receiving any intervention for preventing ICU delirium. The control could be standard ICU care, placebo or both. We assessed the quality of evidence with GRADE.
We checked titles and abstracts to exclude obviously irrelevant studies and obtained full reports on potentially relevant ones. Two review authors independently extracted data. If possible we conducted meta-analyses, otherwise we synthesized data narratively.
The electronic search yielded 8746 records. We included 12 RCTs (3885 participants) comparing usual care with the following interventions: commonly used drugs (four studies); sedation regimens (four studies); physical therapy or cognitive therapy, or both (one study); environmental interventions (two studies); and preventive nursing care (one study). We found 15 ongoing studies and five studies awaiting classification. The participants were 48 to 70 years old; 48% to 74% were male; the mean acute physiology and chronic health evaluation (APACHE II) score was 14 to 28 (range 0 to 71; higher scores correspond to more severe disease and a higher risk of death). With the exception of one study, all participants were mechanically ventilated in medical or surgical ICUs or mixed. The studies were overall at low risk of bias. Six studies were at high risk of detection bias due to lack of blinding of outcome assessors. We report results for the two most commonly explored approaches to delirium prevention: pharmacologic and a non-pharmacologic intervention.Haloperidol versus placebo (two RCTs, 1580 participants)The event rate of ICU delirium was measured in one study including 1439 participants. No difference was identified between groups, (risk ratio (RR) 1.01, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.87 to 1.17) (moderate-quality evidence). Haloperidol versus placebo neither reduced or increased in-hospital mortality, (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.22; 2 studies; 1580 participants (moderate-quality evidence)); the number of delirium- and coma-free days, (mean difference (MD) -0.60, 95% CI -1.37 to 0.17; 2 studies, 1580 participants (moderate-quality of evidence)); number of ventilator-free days (mean 23.8 (MD -0.30, 95% CI -0.93 to 0.33) 1 study; 1439 participants, (high-quality evidence)); length of ICU stay, (MD 0.18, 95% CI -0.60 to 0.97); 2 studies, 1580 participants; high-quality evidence). None of the studies measured cognitive impairment. In one study there were three serious adverse events in the intervention group and five in the placebo group; in the other there were five serious adverse events and three patients died, one in each group. None of the serious adverse events were judged to be related to interventions received (moderate-quality evidence).Physical and cognitive therapy interventions (one study, 65 participants)The study did not measure the event rate of ICU delirium. A physical and cognitive therapy intervention versus standard care neither reduced nor increased in-hospital mortality, (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.40 to 2.20, I² = 0; 1 study, 65 participants; very low-quality evidence); the number of delirium- and coma-free days, (MD -2.8, 95% CI -10.1 to 4.6, I² = 0; 1 study, 65 participants; very low-quality evidence); the number of ventilator-free days (within the first 28/30 days) was median 27.4 (IQR 0 to 29.2) and 25 (IQR 0 to 28.9); 1 study, 65 participants; very low-quality evidence, length of ICU stay, (MD 1.23, 95% CI -0.68 to 3.14, I² = 0; 1 study, 65 participants; very low-quality evidence); cognitive impairment measured by the MMSE: Mini-Mental State Examination with higher scores indicating better function, (MD 0.97, 95% CI -0.19 to 2.13, I² = 0; 1 study, 30 participants; very low-quality evidence); or measured by the Dysexecutive questionnaire (DEX) with lower scores indicating better function (MD -8.76, 95% CI -19.06 to 1.54, I² = 0; 1 study, 30 participants; very low-quality evidence). One patient experienced acute back pain accompanied by hypotensive urgency during physical therapy.
There is probably little or no difference between haloperidol and placebo for preventing ICU delirium but further studies are needed to increase our confidence in the findings. There is insufficient evidence to determine the effects of physical and cognitive intervention on delirium. The effects of other pharmacological interventions, sedation, environmental, and preventive nursing interventions are unclear and warrant further investigation in large multicentre studies. Five studies are awaiting classification and we identified 15 ongoing studies, evaluating pharmacological interventions, sedation regimens, physical and occupational therapy combined or separately, and environmental interventions, that may alter the conclusions of the review in future."," The patient population of focus is adult medical or surgical ICU patients. The participants were 48 to 70 years old; 48% to 74% were male; the mean acute physiology and chronic health evaluation (APACHE II) score was 14 to 28 (range 0 to 71; higher scores correspond to more severe disease and a higher risk of death).

1,"To report 2 patients infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) who presented acutely with Miller Fisher syndrome and polyneuritis cranialis, respectively.
Patient data were obtained from medical records from the University Hospital ""Príncipe de Asturias,"" Alcalá de Henares, and the University Hospital ""12 de Octubre,"" Madrid, Spain.
A 50-year-old man presented with anosmia, ageusia, right internuclear ophthalmoparesis, right fascicular oculomotor palsy, ataxia, areflexia, albuminocytologic dissociation, and positive testing for anti-GD1b-immunoglobulin G antibody. Five days previously, he had developed a cough, malaise, headache, low back pain, and fever. A 39-year-old man presented with ageusia, bilateral abducens palsy, areflexia, and albuminocytologic dissociation. Three days previously, he had developed diarrhea, a low-grade fever, and poor general condition. Oropharyngeal swab test for SARS-CoV-2 by qualitative real-time reverse transcriptase PCR assay was positive in both patients and negative in the CSF. The first patient was treated with IV immunoglobulin and the second with acetaminophen. Two weeks later, both patients made a complete neurologic recovery, except for residual anosmia and ageusia in the first case.
Our 2 cases highlight the rare occurrence of Miller Fisher syndrome and polyneuritis cranialis during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. These neurologic manifestations may occur because of an aberrant immune response to COVID-19. The full clinical spectrum of neurologic symptoms in patients with COVID-19 remains to be characterized.", The patient population of focus is people who have contracted severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). This virus is responsible for causing the disease known as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).,"['severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, coronavirus disease 2019']"
2,"General medical conditions are an important part of the differential diagnosis in athletes presenting with pain or injury. A psoas abscess is a collection of pus in the iliopsoas muscle compartment and is a rare cause of hip, low back, or groin pain. Psoas abscesses may have significant morbidity and mortality, as 20% progress to septic shock. Presenting symptoms are generally nonspecific and the onset may be subacute. Clinical presentation may have features suggestive of other diagnoses, including septic hip arthritis, iliopsoas bursitis, and retrocecal appendicitis. Proper diagnosis and management is critical to prevent complications of septic shock and death. In this unique case, a 19-year-old Division 1 collegiate football player presented to the emergency department 4 days following injury to his right groin during football practice. He complained of severe right groin pain accompanied by fatigue, fevers, nausea, and diarrhea. He later developed septic shock with multisystem organ dysfunction, requiring advanced life support. Imaging revealed an abscess located in the right iliopsoas compartment. After proper treatment, the athlete eventually made a complete recovery, returning to collegiate football 4 months postinjury. A literature review found no described cases of psoas abscess related to athletes with acute hip flexor strain. This athlete had no known risk factors for psoas abscess. This case highlights the importance of maintaining a broad differential in an athlete presenting with pain after injury. Making the diagnosis of psoas abscess often requires a high degree of suspicion and timely acquisition of imaging studies. In this particular case, imaging was key to making a proper diagnosis and tailoring treatment not only to return him to sport but also to save his life.", The patient population of focus is athletes who present with pain or injury.,"['athletes, pain, injury']"
3,"The increase in the older adult and oldest old population in Brazil is growing. This phenomenon may be accompanied by an increase in musculoskeletal symptoms such as low back pain. This condition is usually associated with disability.
To verify the association between pain intensity and disability in older adults with acute low back pain and assess whether these variables differ depending on the age group and marital status.
This is a cross-sectional study conducted with 532 older adults with acute low back pain episodes. Pain intensity was assessed through the Numeric Pain Scale and disability through the Late Life Function and Disability Instrument, which shows two dimensions: ""frequency"" and ""limitation"" in performing activities. The association between pain and disability was analyzed.
For the interaction effect between age groups and marital status, we found that the oldest old living with a partner performed activities of the personal domain less often compared to the oldest old living alone. The oldest old group living with a partner had a lower frequency of performing activities, but did not report feeling limited. The association of pain with disability was minimal (rho<0.20) and thus considered irrelevant.
Disability in older adults with acute low back pain was influenced by the interaction between age groups and marital status and is not associated with pain intensity.", The patient population of focus is older adults with acute low back pain. The study found that disability in this population is influenced by the interaction between age groups and marital status and is not associated with pain intensity.,"['Low back pain, older adults, disability, age groups, marital status, pain intensity']"
4,"Ninety percent of elderly patients with lumbar disc herniation (LDH) have problems with the mechanics of the spine and muscle tissue. Shi-style spine balance manipulation combined with guidance (Daoyin) of muscle and bone as an alternative therapy for LDH can tone the muscle groups around the spine and maintain optimal mechanical and static sagittal balance of the spine. This study will be performed to investigate the effect of a combination of Shi-style spine balance manipulation and Daoyin therapy on LDH in middle-aged and elderly patients. In this non-blinded, randomized controlled trial, 72 eligible patients will be randomly divided into a treatment group (Shi-style spine balance manipulation combined with Daoyin therapy) and a control group (lumbar mechanical traction). Before and after the intervention, lumbar X-ray and magnetic resonance imaging examinations will be performed to observe the sagittal balance parameters of the spine and pelvis and the lumbar muscle strength. The visual analog scale score, Oswestry disability index score, and pressure pain threshold will be evaluated at baseline and at 2, 4, 12, and 24 weeks. During the treatment period, any signs of acute adverse events, such as paralysis of the lower extremities or cauda equina syndrome, will be recorded at each visit. Although Shi-style spine manipulation combined with Daoyin therapy has been used in the treatment of LDH in middle-aged and elderly people in China for many years, there is no consensus on its effectiveness. This experiment will provide convincing evidence of the efficacy of Shi-style spine manipulation combined with Daoyin therapy in the treatment of LDH in middle-aged and elderly people.", The patient population of focus is middle-aged and elderly people with lumbar disc herniation (LDH).,"['LDH, middleaged, elderly, people, lumbar disc herniation']"
5,"A 23-year-old man with acute lymphoblastic leukemia presented to the emergency department without any history of constitutional symptoms (fatigue, anorexia, or weight loss), dyspnea, bruising, or bleeding. Presentation of acute leukemia solely as musculoskeletal pathology is common in pediatric populations but rare among adult patients. Recognizing this presentation of acute leukemia in adult patients could help prevent delayed diagnoses.", The patient population of focus is adult patients with acute leukemia.

6,"BACKGROUND Lumbar discitis caused by Clostridium perfringens is extremely rare. There have only been 7 published cases of confirmed discitis caused by Clostridium perfringens. We write this report to underscore this unusual relationship by discussing an additional case and providing a review of the previously published cases so clinicians can adequately evaluate and treat patients presenting with discitis. CASE REPORT A 64-year-old morbidly obese man presented with an acute onset of worsening back pain and generalized weakness after incurring physical trauma related to falling. Additionally, he also developed fever and chills before the presentation. Based on the clinical presentation and elevated serum levels of inflammatory markers, magnetic resonance imaging was ordered, which showed L5-S1 discitis with extension of infection into the epidural space. Fluoroscopy-guided aspiration of the L5-S1 epidural space facilitated the detection of Clostridium perfringens as the involved pathogen. Based on the antibiotic susceptibility report, the patient was treated with intravenous ampicillin for 8 weeks, after which his symptoms resolved. CONCLUSIONS Diagnosis of discitis can be very challenging due to its ambiguous clinical presentation, especially in the elderly population due to the presence of underlying degenerative changes. Even though Clostridium perfringens remains a rare cause of lumbar discitis, it should be considered as a pathogen capable of causing infection of the vertebrae and intervertebral discs, thus allowing clinicians to make necessary diagnostic evaluations to provide appropriate targeted treatment to patients presenting with discitis."," The patient population of focus is the elderly population. This is because the clinical presentation of discitis can be very ambiguous, especially in the elderly population due to the presence of underlying degenerative changes.","['discitis, elderly, population, focus, clinical presentation, ambiguous']"
7,"Low back pain (LBP) is a growing public health problem in old age, and it is associated with disabling pain and depressive disorders. We compared brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) plasma levels, a key neurotrophin in pain modulation, between older women after an acute episode of LBP and age-matched pain-free controls, and investigated potential differences in BDNF levels between controls and LBP subgroups based on pain severity, presence of depressive symptoms and use of analgesic and antidepressant drugs.
A total of 221 participants (154 with LBP and 67 pain-free) were studied. A comprehensive assessment of sociodemographic and clinical variables was conducted including pain severity (11-point NRS), depressive symptoms (GDS-15), age, body mass index, physical activity and total number of comorbidities and medications in use.
BDNF levels in LBP group were significantly higher than controls (7515.9±3021.2; Md=7116.0 vs 6331.8±3364.0; Md=5897.5pg/mL, P=0.005). LBP subgroups exhibited higher BDNF levels than controls, regardless of pain severity, presence of depressive symptoms and use of analgesic drugs. BDNF levels were significantly higher in LBP subgroup without use of antidepressant drugs compared to both controls and LBP subgroup with use of antidepressant drugs.
This study provides evidence that older women with acute low back pain exhibit higher BDNF plasma levels compared to pain-free controls. Subgroup comparisons suggest that use of pain-relief drugs may influence BDNF levels. The study results offer a novel target for research on mechanisms of back pain in older adults."," The patient population of focus is older women with acute low back pain. The study found that these women have higher levels of BDNF (a key neurotrophin in pain modulation) than age-matched pain-free controls. Additionally, subgroup comparisons suggest that use of pain-relief drugs may influence BDNF levels.","['older women, acute low back pain, BDNF, neurotrophin, pain modulation']"
