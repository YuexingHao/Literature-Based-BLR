Critically ill patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) frequently develop ICU delirium. It can profoundly affect both them and their families because it is associated with increased mortality, longer duration of mechanical ventilation, longer hospital and ICU stay and long-term cognitive impairment. It also results in increased costs for society.
To assess existing evidence for the effect of preventive interventions on ICU delirium, in-hospital mortality, the number of delirium- and coma-free days, ventilator-free days, length of stay in the ICU and cognitive impairment.
We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, BIOSIS, International Web of Science, Latin American Caribbean Health Sciences Literature, CINAHL from 1980 to 11 April 2018 without any language limits. We adapted the MEDLINE search for searching the other databases. Furthermore, we checked references, searched citations and contacted study authors to identify additional studies. We also checked the following trial registries: Current Controlled Trials; ClinicalTrials.gov; and CenterWatch.com (all on 24 April 2018).
We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of adult medical or surgical ICU patients receiving any intervention for preventing ICU delirium. The control could be standard ICU care, placebo or both. We assessed the quality of evidence with GRADE.
We checked titles and abstracts to exclude obviously irrelevant studies and obtained full reports on potentially relevant ones. Two review authors independently extracted data. If possible we conducted meta-analyses, otherwise we synthesized data narratively.
The electronic search yielded 8746 records. We included 12 RCTs (3885 participants) comparing usual care with the following interventions: commonly used drugs (four studies); sedation regimens (four studies); physical therapy or cognitive therapy, or both (one study); environmental interventions (two studies); and preventive nursing care (one study). We found 15 ongoing studies and five studies awaiting classification. The participants were 48 to 70 years old; 48% to 74% were male; the mean acute physiology and chronic health evaluation (APACHE II) score was 14 to 28 (range 0 to 71; higher scores correspond to more severe disease and a higher risk of death). With the exception of one study, all participants were mechanically ventilated in medical or surgical ICUs or mixed. The studies were overall at low risk of bias. Six studies were at high risk of detection bias due to lack of blinding of outcome assessors. We report results for the two most commonly explored approaches to delirium prevention: pharmacologic and a non-pharmacologic intervention.Haloperidol versus placebo (two RCTs, 1580 participants)The event rate of ICU delirium was measured in one study including 1439 participants. No difference was identified between groups, (risk ratio (RR) 1.01, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.87 to 1.17) (moderate-quality evidence). Haloperidol versus placebo neither reduced or increased in-hospital mortality, (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.22; 2 studies; 1580 participants (moderate-quality evidence)); the number of delirium- and coma-free days, (mean difference (MD) -0.60, 95% CI -1.37 to 0.17; 2 studies, 1580 participants (moderate-quality of evidence)); number of ventilator-free days (mean 23.8 (MD -0.30, 95% CI -0.93 to 0.33) 1 study; 1439 participants, (high-quality evidence)); length of ICU stay, (MD 0.18, 95% CI -0.60 to 0.97); 2 studies, 1580 participants; high-quality evidence). None of the studies measured cognitive impairment. In one study there were three serious adverse events in the intervention group and five in the placebo group; in the other there were five serious adverse events and three patients died, one in each group. None of the serious adverse events were judged to be related to interventions received (moderate-quality evidence).Physical and cognitive therapy interventions (one study, 65 participants)The study did not measure the event rate of ICU delirium. A physical and cognitive therapy intervention versus standard care neither reduced nor increased in-hospital mortality, (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.40 to 2.20, I² = 0; 1 study, 65 participants; very low-quality evidence); the number of delirium- and coma-free days, (MD -2.8, 95% CI -10.1 to 4.6, I² = 0; 1 study, 65 participants; very low-quality evidence); the number of ventilator-free days (within the first 28/30 days) was median 27.4 (IQR 0 to 29.2) and 25 (IQR 0 to 28.9); 1 study, 65 participants; very low-quality evidence, length of ICU stay, (MD 1.23, 95% CI -0.68 to 3.14, I² = 0; 1 study, 65 participants; very low-quality evidence); cognitive impairment measured by the MMSE: Mini-Mental State Examination with higher scores indicating better function, (MD 0.97, 95% CI -0.19 to 2.13, I² = 0; 1 study, 30 participants; very low-quality evidence); or measured by the Dysexecutive questionnaire (DEX) with lower scores indicating better function (MD -8.76, 95% CI -19.06 to 1.54, I² = 0; 1 study, 30 participants; very low-quality evidence). One patient experienced acute back pain accompanied by hypotensive urgency during physical therapy.
There is probably little or no difference between haloperidol and placebo for preventing ICU delirium but further studies are needed to increase our confidence in the findings. There is insufficient evidence to determine the effects of physical and cognitive intervention on delirium. The effects of other pharmacological interventions, sedation, environmental, and preventive nursing interventions are unclear and warrant further investigation in large multicentre studies. Five studies are awaiting classification and we identified 15 ongoing studies, evaluating pharmacological interventions, sedation regimens, physical and occupational therapy combined or separately, and environmental interventions, that may alter the conclusions of the review in future."

Patient data were obtained from medical records from the University Hospital ""Príncipe de Asturias,"" Alcalá de Henares, and the University Hospital ""12 de Octubre,"" Madrid, Spain.
A 50-year-old man presented with anosmia, ageusia, right internuclear ophthalmoparesis, right fascicular oculomotor palsy, ataxia, areflexia, albuminocytologic dissociation, and positive testing for anti-GD1b-immunoglobulin G antibody. Five days previously, he had developed a cough, malaise, headache, low back pain, and fever. A 39-year-old man presented with ageusia, bilateral abducens palsy, areflexia, and albuminocytologic dissociation. Three days previously, he had developed diarrhea, a low-grade fever, and poor general condition. Oropharyngeal swab test for SARS-CoV-2 by qualitative real-time reverse transcriptase PCR assay was positive in both patients and negative in the CSF. The first patient was treated with IV immunoglobulin and the second with acetaminophen. Two weeks later, both patients made a complete neurologic recovery, except for residual anosmia and ageusia in the first case.
Our 2 cases highlight the rare occurrence of Miller Fisher syndrome and polyneuritis cranialis during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. These neurologic manifestations may occur because of an aberrant immune response to COVID-19. The full clinical spectrum of neurologic symptoms in patients with COVID-19 remains to be characterized."
2,A Pain in the Psoas.,27542388,2016-08-21,"['Charlotte M H Moriarty', 'Robert J Baker']","['Orthopedics Rhode Island, Wakefield, Rhode Island.', 'Department of Sports Medicine, Homer Stryker M.D. School of Medicine, Western Michigan University, Kalamazoo, Michigan.']","A psoas abscess is a collection of pus in the iliopsoas muscle compartment and is a rare cause of hip, low back, or groin pain.","General medical conditions are an important part of the differential diagnosis in athletes presenting with pain or injury. A psoas abscess is a collection of pus in the iliopsoas muscle compartment and is a rare cause of hip, low back, or groin pain. Psoas abscesses may have significant morbidity and mortality, as 20% progress to septic shock. Presenting symptoms are generally nonspecific and the onset may be subacute. Clinical presentation may have features suggestive of other diagnoses, including septic hip arthritis, iliopsoas bursitis, and retrocecal appendicitis. Proper diagnosis and management is critical to prevent complications of septic shock and death. In this unique case, a 19-year-old Division 1 collegiate football player presented to the emergency department 4 days following injury to his right groin during football practice. He complained of severe right groin pain accompanied by fatigue, fevers, nausea, and diarrhea. He later developed septic shock with multisystem organ dysfunction, requiring advanced life support. Imaging revealed an abscess located in the right iliopsoas compartment. After proper treatment, the athlete eventually made a complete recovery, returning to collegiate football 4 months postinjury. A literature review found no described cases of psoas abscess related to athletes with acute hip flexor strain. This athlete had no known risk factors for psoas abscess. This case highlights the importance of maintaining a broad differential in an athlete presenting with pain after injury. Making the diagnosis of psoas abscess often requires a high degree of suspicion and timely acquisition of imaging studies. In this particular case, imaging was key to making a proper diagnosis and tailoring treatment not only to return him to sport but also to save his life."

This phenomenon may be accompanied by an increase in musculoskeletal symptoms such as low back pain. This condition is usually associated with disability.
To verify the association between pain intensity and disability in older adults with acute low back pain and assess whether these variables differ depending on the age group and marital status.
This is a cross-sectional study conducted with 532 older adults with acute low back pain episodes. Pain intensity was assessed through the Numeric Pain Scale and disability through the Late Life Function and Disability Instrument, which shows two dimensions: ""frequency"" and ""limitation"" in performing activities. The association between pain and disability was analyzed.
For the interaction effect between age groups and marital status, we found that the oldest old living with a partner performed activities of the personal domain less often compared to the oldest old living alone. The oldest old group living with a partner had a lower frequency of performing activities, but did not report feeling limited. The association of pain with disability was minimal (rho<0.20) and thus considered irrelevant.
Disability in older adults with acute low back pain was influenced by the interaction between age groups and marital status and is not associated with pain intensity."

Shi-style spine balance manipulation combined with guidance (Daoyin) of muscle and bone as an alternative therapy for LDH can tone the muscle groups around the spine and maintain optimal mechanical and static sagittal balance of the spine. This study will be performed to investigate the effect of a combination of Shi-style spine balance manipulation and Daoyin therapy on LDH in middle-aged and elderly patients. In this non-blinded, randomized controlled trial, 72 eligible patients will be randomly divided into a treatment group (Shi-style spine balance manipulation combined with Daoyin therapy) and a control group (lumbar mechanical traction). Before and after the intervention, lumbar X-ray and magnetic resonance imaging examinations will be performed to observe the sagittal balance parameters of the spine and pelvis and the lumbar muscle strength. The visual analog scale score, Oswestry disability index score, and pressure pain threshold will be evaluated at baseline and at 2, 4, 12, and 24 weeks. During the treatment period, any signs of acute adverse events, such as paralysis of the lower extremities or cauda equina syndrome, will be recorded at each visit. Although Shi-style spine manipulation combined with Daoyin therapy has been used in the treatment of LDH in middle-aged and elderly people in China for many years, there is no consensus on its effectiveness. This experiment will provide convincing evidence of the efficacy of Shi-style spine manipulation combined with Daoyin therapy in the treatment of LDH in middle-aged and elderly people."

There have only been 7 published cases of confirmed discitis caused by Clostridium perfringens. We write this report to underscore this unusual relationship by discussing an additional case and providing a review of the previously published cases so clinicians can adequately evaluate and treat patients presenting with discitis. CASE REPORT A 64-year-old morbidly obese man presented with an acute onset of worsening back pain and generalized weakness after incurring physical trauma related to falling. Additionally, he also developed fever and chills before the presentation. Based on the clinical presentation and elevated serum levels of inflammatory markers, magnetic resonance imaging was ordered, which showed L5-S1 discitis with extension of infection into the epidural space. Fluoroscopy-guided aspiration of the L5-S1 epidural space facilitated the detection of Clostridium perfringens as the involved pathogen. Based on the antibiotic susceptibility report, the patient was treated with intravenous ampicillin for 8 weeks, after which his symptoms resolved. CONCLUSIONS Diagnosis of discitis can be very challenging due to its ambiguous clinical presentation, especially in the elderly population due to the presence of underlying degenerative changes. Even though Clostridium perfringens remains a rare cause of lumbar discitis, it should be considered as a pathogen capable of causing infection of the vertebrae and intervertebral discs, thus allowing clinicians to make necessary diagnostic evaluations to provide appropriate targeted treatment to patients presenting with discitis."

We compared brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) plasma levels, a key neurotrophin in pain modulation, between older women after an acute episode of LBP and age-matched pain-free controls, and investigated potential differences in BDNF levels between controls and LBP subgroups based on pain severity, presence of depressive symptoms and use of analgesic and antidepressant drugs.
A total of 221 participants (154 with LBP and 67 pain-free) were studied. A comprehensive assessment of sociodemographic and clinical variables was conducted including pain severity (11-point NRS), depressive symptoms (GDS-15), age, body mass index, physical activity and total number of comorbidities and medications in use.
BDNF levels in LBP group were significantly higher than controls (7515.9±3021.2; Md=7116.0 vs 6331.8±3364.0; Md=5897.5pg/mL, P=0.005). LBP subgroups exhibited higher BDNF levels than controls, regardless of pain severity, presence of depressive symptoms and use of analgesic drugs. BDNF levels were significantly higher in LBP subgroup without use of antidepressant drugs compared to both controls and LBP subgroup with use of antidepressant drugs.
This study provides evidence that older women with acute low back pain exhibit higher BDNF plasma levels compared to pain-free controls. Subgroup comparisons suggest that use of pain-relief drugs may influence BDNF levels. The study results offer a novel target for research on mechanisms of back pain in older adults."

The minimal clinically important difference (MCID) in the AM-PAC score has not been determined.
The study objective was to determine the MCID for AM-PAC in people with low back pain.
This was a retrospective cohort study.
Anchor-based and distribution-based methods were used to estimate the MCID. The Modified Low Back Pain Disability Questionnaire was used as the anchor. Adults who had a primary ICD-9 code for low back pain in at least 1 outpatient physical therapist visit during an episode of care and who completed both the AM-PAC and the Modified Low Back Pain Disability Questionnaire in at least 2 visits during the care episode were included. The MCID was calculated for the AM-PAC basic mobility version as well its adapted version, which the Cleveland Clinic uses for patients 65 years old or older.
A total of 1,271 participants were eligible for study. For the AM-PAC basic mobility version, anchor-based methods yielded MCID estimates of between 3.4 and 5.1, whereas distribution-based methods yielded estimates of 1.7 to 4.2. The minimal detectable change (MDC) for the AM-PAC basic mobility version was 3.3. For the adapted AM-PAC basic mobility version, the MCID was estimated to be between 2.9 and 4.0 via anchor-based methods and between 1.2 to 3.5 via distribution-based methods. The MDC for the adapted AM-PAC basic mobility version was 3.5.
The estimated MCID was designed for people with low back pain only.
The MCID ranged from 3.3 to 5.1 for the AM-PAC basic mobility version and 3.5 to 4 for the adapted version, with the MDC as the lower limit. Changes in the AM-PAC for people with low back pain may be interpreted using the estimated MCID. Future studies are needed to determine the AM-PAC MCID for populations other than those with low back pain."

We report our experience in treating three SIJ dysfunction patients presenting with acute low back pain (a 38 year-old male, a 24 year-old male, and a 32 year-old female). SIJ dysfunction was diagnosed using the one-finger test, the modified Newton test, and SIJ injection. In all three patients, lumbar MRI demonstrated slightly degenerated lumbar lesions (lumbar canal stenosis, lumbar disc hernia). Two patients had paresthesia or pain in the leg and all three patients showed iliac muscle tenderness in the groin, which was thought to be a referred symptom because of improvement after SIJ injection. The two male patients returned to work and the problems have not recurred. Although our female patient resumed daily life as a housewife, her condition recurred at intervals of 2-3 months and she required regular SIJ injections. The prevalence of SIJ dysfunction of low back pain is about 10%, so it should be considered as a differential diagnosis when treating low back pain and designing treatment for lumbar spinal disorders."

To investigate the relationship of the anterior trunk mobility with self-report and physical performance measures in elderly women with acute low back pain (LBP).
LBP is one of the most prevalent pain complaints in the elderly population. It is postulated that the increased range of motion of limited joints of the trunk may improve LBP and functionality of patients. Recent studies have, however, questioned the association between trunk range of motion and the functional status.
The present study included a convenience sample of elderly women from the community aged 60 years and older who presented with a new (acute) episode of LBP. Volunteers with severe diseases and visual, hearing and mobility losses, or cognitive impairment were excluded. Trunk mobility was assessed by the fingertip-to-floor test. Functionality was assessed by the Roland-Morris Questionnaire (RMQ) and gait speed test. Statistical analysis was performed by using hierarchical linear regression model.
Data from 459 elderly women, mean age of 69.0 (6.1) years old, were used to describe this report. The additional predictive value for the inclusion of independent variable trunk mobility was only 4.4% in the RMQ score and 1.5% in the gait speed test, respectively. A reduced hierarchical linear regression model showed that the significant predictors for RMQ and gait speed test were body mass index, pain intensity, and trunk mobility.
This was the first study to investigate the relationship between trunk mobility and functionality in elderly women with acute LBP. The results suggest that these clinical parameters are independent from each other.

There is a wide range of possible etiologies, and tumors such as primary spinal hemangiomas are uncommon. Most are incidental findings and asymptomatic; however, painful lesions can be presented in up to 0.9% to 1.2% of cases. These lesions can produce neurologic involvement either spinal cord compression or cauda equina syndrome as in our case. The aim of this study is to describe a case of low back pain in a child due to a vertebral hemangioma complicated with acute cauda equina syndrome, and performed a literature review that will help us to recognize this aggressive variance making an early treatment feasible.
A 13-year-old female, follow-up in an outer health care center due to a L1 vertebral hemangioma, characterized by 3 years of low back pain without neurologic symptoms presented to our emergency department with an acute cauda equina syndrome.
An outside magnetic resonance imaging showed complete obliteration of the spinal canal at the level of the conus medullaris related to retropulsion of bone at L1. She underwent 2-stage surgical treatment: complete posterior L1 laminectomy and partial T12-L2 laminectomies, with partial L1 vertebrectomy and posterior fusion with instrumention from T11 to L3. Three weeks later, embolization before anterior fusion with inner body cage was performed. Forty months after surgery, she is doing well with no neurologic deficits.
Even though hemangiomas are not a common cause of back pain, they should be taken into account. It is important to recognize the aggressive variance so an early treatment could be performed. There is no enough clinical data to establish guidelines of management in children, therefore, the treatment should be individualized."

We conducted a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the effect of ISWI for relief of acute low back pain (aLBP). A total of 68 patients (41 females and 27 males) between 18 and 55 years old experiencing aLBP with moderate to severe pain (scores ≥5 on an 11-point visual analogue scale [VAS]) were recruited and randomly assigned to receive either ISWIs (n=34) or intracutaneous isotonic saline injections (placebo treatment; n=34). The primary outcome was improvement in pain intensity using the VAS at 10, 45, and 90 min and 1 day after treatment. The secondary outcome was functional improvement, which was assessed using the Patient-Specific Functional Scale (PSFS) 1 day after treatment. The mean VAS score was significantly lower in the ISWI group than in the control group at 10, 45, and 90 min, and 1 day after injection (P<0.05, t-test). The mean increment in PSFS score of the ISWI group was 2.9±2.2 1 day after treatment, while that in the control group was 0.9±2.2. Our study showed that ISWI was effective for relieving pain and improving function in aLBP patients at short-term follow-up. ISWI might be an alternative treatment for aLBP patients, especially in areas where medications are not available, as well as in specific patients (e.g., those who are pregnant or have asthma), who are unable to receive medications or other forms of analgesia because of side effects."

Several studies have investigated the relationship between kinesiophobia and functionality in patients with chronic LBP. However, to the best of the authors' knowledge, no studies have investigated the association between kinesiophobia and self-reported assessments of disability and physical performance in elderly patients with acute LBP.
The study aimed to investigate the association between kinesiophobia and self-reported and physical performance measures among the elderly with acute LBP.
This was an observational, cross-sectional, ancillary study of the Back Complaints in the Elders study, a longitudinal observational epidemiologic research project by an international consortium involving Brazil, the Netherlands, and Australia.
Sample selection was carried out by convenience. The study included women from the community aged 60 years old and older who presented with a new episode of LBP. Volunteers with severe diseases, as well as visual, hearing, and mobility losses, or cognitive dysfunction, were excluded. Four hundred fifty nine elderly women (mean age: 69.0±6.1 years) were included.
Kinesiophobia was evaluated by Fear Avoidance Beliefs Questionnaire (FABQ), subscale FABQ-Phys. Functionality was investigated by the Roland-Morris Questionnaire and the gait speed test.
Statistical analysis was performed using hierarchical linear regression model. Statistical significance was established at the level of .05.
The additional predictive value because of the inclusion of the FABQ-Phys was 0.1%, using the Roland-Morris score, and 0.2% for the gait speed test.
This was the first study to investigate the association between the FABQ-Phys and functionality in elderly patients with acute LBP. The results provide preliminary evidence that kinesiophobia assessed by the FABQ-Phys cannot be generalized to disability."
15,Cognitive load and the effectiveness of distraction for acute pain in children.,33756023,2021-03-24,"['Wendy M Gaultney', 'Lynnda M Dahlquist', 'Raimi L Quiton']","['Department of Psychology, University of Maryland, Baltimore County, MD, USA.', 'Department of Psychology, University of Maryland, Baltimore County, MD, USA.', 'Department of Psychology, University of Maryland, Baltimore County, MD, USA.']",The study found that a high-demand working memory task was more effective than a low-demand motor control task in reducing pain intensity and unpleasantness in children aged 9-13.,"Distraction tasks that place continuous, high demand on executive resources have been shown to reduce pain intensity and pain unpleasantness ratings in some healthy adult samples. We examined the effects of a high-demand 'working memory' 1-back task compared to a low-demand 'motor control' task on pain intensity and unpleasantness ratings in healthy children. Additionally, dispositional mindfulness was examined to explore the mechanisms of distraction on the affective processing of pain.
Fifty-seven children (9-13 years old) experienced three randomly presented heat levels (not painful, slightly painful, moderately painful) during two distraction conditions involving different levels of cognitive load (a high load 'working memory' task and a low load 'motor' control task) in counter-balanced order. Children completed measures of dispositional mindfulness, and attentional control and emotional control.
As predicted, children's pain intensity and pain unpleasantness ratings were lower in the high load condition compared to the low load condition. These differences were amplified in the moderately painful heat trials. In contrast with predictions, dispositional mindfulness did not significantly predict the effectiveness of distraction. Dispositional mindfulness was significantly related to measures of children's attentional and emotional control abilities; however, an exploratory serial mediation model did not produce significant indirect or overall effects to suggest a strong influence of mindfulness on the effectiveness of distraction.
Results demonstrate that distraction that places higher demand on executive resources is more effective for acute pain management for children. Further research is needed to explore cognitive and affective moderators of the effectiveness of distraction for children.
This study is one of the first to demonstrate that working-memory engagement can attenuate pain intensity and pain unpleasantness in children aged 9-13. The findings suggest that distraction tasks used in clinical settings for moderately painful medical procedures may benefit more children if they are adequately demanding of cognitive resources."

To assess changes in pain levels and physical functioning in response to standard medical care (SMC) versus SMC plus chiropractic manipulative therapy (CMT) for the treatment of low back pain (LBP) among 18 to 35-year-old active-duty military personnel.
LBP is common, costly, and a significant cause of long-term sick leave and work loss. Many different interventions are available, but there exists no consensus on the best approach. One intervention often used is manipulative therapy. Current evidence from randomized controlled trials demonstrates that manipulative therapy may be as effective as other conservative treatments of LBP, but its appropriate role in the healthcare delivery system has not been established.
Prospective, 2-arm randomized controlled trial pilot study comparing SMC plus CMT with only SMC. The primary outcome measures were changes in back-related pain on the numerical rating scale and physical functioning at 4 weeks on the Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire and back pain functional scale (BPFS).
Mean Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire scores decreased in both groups during the course of the study, but adjusted mean scores were significantly better in the SMC plus CMT group than in the SMC group at both week 2 (P < 0.001) and week 4 (P = 0.004). Mean numerical rating scale pain scores were also significantly better in the group that received CMT. Adjusted mean back pain functional scale scores were significantly higher (improved) in the SMC plus CMT group than in the SMC group at both week 2 (P < 0.001) and week 4 (P = 0.004).
The results of this trial suggest that CMT in conjunction with SMC offers a significant advantage for decreasing pain and improving physical functioning when compared with only standard care, for men and women between 18 and 35 years of age with acute LBP."

This was a practice-based, nonrandomized, comparative study of patients self-referring to 60 doctors of chiropractic and 111 medical doctors in 51 chiropractic and 14 general practice community clinics over a 2-year period. Patients were included if they were at least 18 years old, ambulatory, and had low back pain of mechanical origin (n = 2780). Outcomes were (standardized) office costs, office costs plus referral costs for office-based care and advanced imaging, pain, functional disability, patient satisfaction, physical health, and mental health evaluated at 3 and 12 months after the start of care. Multiple regression analysis was used to correct for baseline differences between provider types.
Chiropractic office costs were higher for both acute and chronic patients (P < .01). When referrals were included, there were no significant differences in either group between provider types (P > .20). Acute and chronic chiropractic patients experienced better outcomes in pain, functional disability, and patient satisfaction (P < .01); clinically important differences in pain and disability improvement were found for chronic patients only.
Chiropractic care appeared relatively cost-effective for the treatment of chronic LBP. Chiropractic and medical care performed comparably for acute patients. Practice-based clinical outcomes were consistent with systematic reviews of spinal manipulation efficacy: manipulation-based therapy is at least as good as and, in some cases, better than other therapeusis. This evidence can guide physicians, payers, and policy makers in evaluating chiropractic as a treatment option for low back pain."

Repetitive lifting, with combined twisting and flexion motions of the lumbar spine, increases the risk for low-back pain and injury to the supporting tissues.
A 60-year-old male who presented with acute low-back pain, with a pain intensity of 6/10 on the visual analog scale (VAS) and an Oswestry disability index (ODI) score of 70%. The range of motion (ROM) of the lumbar spine on initial examination, relative to the normal peak ROM, was as follows: extension, 12°/30°; flexion, 15°/80°; left rotation, 15°/45°; and right rotation, 25°/45°.
He was diagnosed as acute nonspecific low-back pain sustained with repetitive lifting, combining motions of flexion and twisting.
The balance taping was applied for 16 h/day, on average, for 3 consecutive days was used as the primary treatment to manage the patient's low-back pain.
The application of balance taping increased the range of motion of the lumbar spine as follows: flexion, from 15° to 77°; extension, from 12° to 27°; right rotation, from 25° to 45°; and left rotation, from 15° to 45°. The ODI score decreased from 70% to 0%, and the VAS score from 6/10 to 0.
We propose that balance taping using kinesiology tape could serve as a complementary approach to other treatments for the treatment of acute nonspecific low-back pain."
