<h3>The full description of case one</h3>
<p>A 55-year-old woman presents seeking treatment with clear symptoms of a major depressive episode. This is her third such episode. She reports that sertraline worked well for her the first time. The second time, however, it made her dizzy and she had to discontinue; she eventually responded well <span id="dots">...</span><span id="more"> to bupropion. She expresses a preference for medication over psychotherapy but is not sure which one to try. She tries bupropion and it worked last time, but in exploring her current symptoms it is clear that she has prominent feelings of somatic and psychological anxiety that she did not experience last time. Overall, her condition is less acute, and you recall a meta-analysis suggesting that anti-depressants are less effective in milder cases of depression. She experienced trauma during adolescence, has been unable to fall asleep in the evenings, and has extreme feelings of worthlessness.<br><br>
