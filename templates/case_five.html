<h3>The full description of case one</h3>
<p>A 62-year-old man was evaluated in the psychiatry clinic of this hospital because of depression and worsening anxiety. <span id="dots">...</span><span id="more"> The patient had received a diagnosis of major depressive disorder from a psychiatrist 15 years before this presentation, after his wife had received a diagnosis of cancer while she was pregnant with their daughter. The patient had severe depression and the onset of generalized anxiety symptoms in association with his wife’s progressive illness and ultimate death. Trials of buspirone, sertraline, and escitalopram were ineffective, but depression and anxiety symptoms diminished with the use of citalopram and clonazepam. The patient continued to use these two medications to control his depression and anxiety, and he stopped seeing his psychiatrist after almost 7 years of treatment, remaining under the care of his primary care physician. Six years later, he discontinued citalopram. One year later (20 months before this presentation), the patient contacted his primary care physician to report recurrent anxiety, depression, and lethargy. Citalopram was restarted. On evaluation in the primary care clinic 3 weeks later, he reported that his condition had improved with the use of medication but lethargy persisted. On examination, the blood pressure was 108/75 mm Hg, and the heart rate 130 beats per minute and irregular. An electrocardiogram (ECG) and rhythm strip (Figure 1) showed new atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response. Treatment with metoprolol succinate and dabigatran was initiated, and during the next 4 weeks, the metoprolol dose was adjusted to control the heart rate. Transthoracic echocardiography revealed left atrial and left ventricular dilatation, a low-normal left ventricular ejection fraction, mild left ventricular hypertrophy, and no clinically significant valvular disease. Four weeks later (18 months before this presentation), the patient was evaluated in the cardiology clinic of this hospital; he reported daily episodes of palpitations. The blood pressure was 140/60 mm Hg, and the heart rate 60 beats per minute and regular. An ECG showed normal sinus rhythm with a slightly prolonged corrected QT (QTc) interval, measuring 466 msec. Holter monitoring for 24 hours was performed to assess for control of the heart rate; the average heart rate was 65 beats per minute, the maximum heart rate was 84 beats per minute, and no episodes of atrial fibrillation were detected. Approximately 1 year later (5 months before this presentation), the patient reported several weeks of heightened anxiety and recurrent depressive symptoms, which were in part due to financial stressors and the fact that his girlfriend of several years had received a diagnosis of recurrent cancer. The patient was binge drinking intermittently. He reported weekly panic attacks that were characterized by a “racing” heart, light-headedness, restlessness, and shaking; the panic attacks lasted 30 minutes and had some correlation with episodes of increased alcohol intake. After 4 months of persistent symptoms, the patient sought psychiatry consultation. One month later, on evaluation in the psychiatry clinic, the patient described his mood as depressed and anxious. He had persistent anxiety and panic symptoms, as well as worsened depressive symptoms, including difficulty concentrating, low energy, low self-worth, and sleeping for 2 to 3 hours more than usual each night. He reported having a stable appetite but had lost 6.4 kg during the preceding 18 months. He had had no hallucinations or thoughts of harming himself or others. He again reported weekly panic attacks that were characterized by a racing heart, light-headedness, restlessness, shaking, and generalized weakness. Some of these episodes had lasted several hours. There were no predictable triggers; the episodes had occurred at all times of day and had occasionally awakened him from sleep. He reported no chest pain or dyspnea. The patient’s medical history was notable for atrial fibrillation, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, asthma, gastroesophageal reflux, osteoarthritis, colonic polyps, and vitamin D deficiency. He had undergone appendectomy and knee arthroplasty. He had had no psychiatric hospitalizations. Medications were citalopram, clonazepam, dabigatran, metoprolol succinate, fluticasone, and albuterol. Montelukast had caused an adverse reaction, and sertraline had caused paresthesia. The patient’s parents had a history of heavy alcohol use. Several paternal relatives had a history of depression, and a maternal aunt had died of an intentional drug overdose. His mother had had emphysema and had died of breast cancer. His father had had hyperlipidemia and had died of asbestosis. The patient was born and raised in New England. He had completed an undergraduate degree and had worked at a university for 20 years; in the past year, because of financial stressors, he had begun to work two jobs in retail. The patient did not smoke cigarettes and reported no illicit drug use. He reported drinking 4 to 6 servings of whiskey weekly, with occasional binges. On examination, the blood pressure was 112/67 mm Hg, and the heart rate 64 beats per minute and regular. The patient was well groomed, alert, oriented, and cooperative. He had fluent speech. His mood was sad and dysphoric, and his affect was flat. His thought process was goal-directed, and his attention was intact. He had good insight into his worsening depressive and anxiety symptoms. On review of laboratory data obtained during the previous 5 months, results of tests of thyroid function, kidney function, and liver function were normal, as were electrolyte levels and the complete blood count. Treatment with clonazepam and citalopram was continued, and aripiprazole was initiated. Three weeks after this presentation, the patient had fatigue and several episodes of palpitations followed by near syncope. He had no chest pain or dyspnea. He presented to the emergency department of this hospital. The temperature was 36.6°C, the blood pressure 163/92 mm Hg, and the heart rate 120 beats per minute and irregular. He appeared to be well. Results of urinalysis, urine toxicologic testing, and kidney-function tests were normal, as were electrolyte and troponin T levels and the complete blood count. An ECG showed atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response and nonspecific ST-segment changes. Intravenous and oral diltiazem were administered. While the patient was undergoing telemetry monitoring, he had two episodes of near syncope that correlated with sinus pauses of 6 seconds and 7 seconds. He was admitted to the cardiology unit, and a dual-chamber permanent pacemaker was placed. Metoprolol succinate was continued, and the patient was discharged home 2 days later. Two weeks later, the patient was seen in the psychiatry clinic. He reported marked improvement in his mood and energy after the initiation of aripiprazole; he did not report any further episodes of anxiety or panic. He had stable hypersomnia, ongoing fatigue, and late-day mental “fogginess.” On evaluation at the primary care clinic 3 days later, the blood pressure was 124/82 mm Hg, and the heart rate 69 beats per minute and regular. Metoprolol was discontinued because of fatigue. Three weeks later, the patient reported to his psychiatrist that he had missed work because of increasing anxiousness, with the feeling of a racing and “thumping” heart and excessive worry. He reported that aripiprazole was not controlling his anxiety symptoms. He stated that his mood was “good” and his energy, sleep, and appetite were unchanged, but he had noticed weakness in his legs, restlessness, and some new difficulty breathing in association with his anxiety symptoms. The aripiprazole dose was increased. Several days later, a diagnostic test was performed.<br><br>
