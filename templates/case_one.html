<h3>The full description of case one</h3>
<p>A 64-year-old woman was admitted to this hospital with cognitive impairment, headache, and memory loss. The patient had been well until 6 weeks before admission, when respiratory symptoms developed. Testing of a nasopharyngeal swab for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA was negative. At around the same time, coworkers observed a decline in the patient’s performance at work. The patient noticed that she was having difficulty operating computers and was forgetting her personal passwords. The patient was evaluated at another hospital. Although she reported recent confusion and changes in cognitive performance, the examination at that time — including a neurologic examination with assessment of orientation, speech, and memory recall after 5 and 20 minutes — was unremarkable. The patient was referred for an outpatient neurologic evaluation. One week later (5 weeks before admission), severe headache developed suddenly, along with blurred vision, dizziness, and nausea. After the administration of ondansetron, the blurred vision, dizziness, and nausea resolved; after the administration of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, the headache became less severe, with mild pain and intermittent episodes of more severe pain. Three weeks before admission, the patient was seen in a neurology clinic affiliated with the other hospital. She had difficulty recalling the history of her symptoms. On examination, she was oriented to place and person only and was unable to perform serial sevens calculations or to spell “world” backward. The remainder of the examination was unremarkable. The complete blood count with differential count and test results for liver and kidney function were normal, as were blood levels of electrolytes, glucose, thiamine, and cobalamin. Tests for syphilis and human immunodeficiency virus infection were negative... An electroencephalogram (EEG) showed no distinct epileptiform activity. Topiramate was prescribed for a working diagnosis of complex migraine. <span id="dots">...</span><span id="more"> <br><br>
